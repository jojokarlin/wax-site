Oh to understand how these images will appear! I am working my way through the template as I revisit all the drawings from the semster.

I am concerned that these essays will be impoverished because I've been between windows on my computer trying to reconcile filenames and image compressions and directories on directories.

Ideally, the liquid includes functions will work seamlessly.


{% include parallax_image.html collection='img' pid='img30' y='50%' %}


I've gone through the passages laid out in the wax template. I've replaced pids with my own pids. I changed those at one point. Hopefully the file naming will help me keep track. I probably should have stuck to the class drawings only. But I wanted to see how much time it would take to build up a collection. 

My basic process is this:
- I scan the image with my lightweight canon scanner.
- I open the image in Adobe Photoshop and trim the edges. 
- I "Save As" in the website directory with the following filename convention. YYYYMMDD-EventTitle.jpg. I let Adobe convert to .jpg.
- I then ran the images through imagecompressor.com.
- I unzipped the image files in the img directory in my wax_site directory.
- I checked that my Google sheet had all the pids that correspond to the img directory files.

Now I have to see if it will work. I'm editing the markdown in the template as a "let's see what happens" sort of effort.
