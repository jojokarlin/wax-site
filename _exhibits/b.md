When first we met, we were online. It was spring semester 2022 and Omicron had just swept New York. I was still experiencing the lingering fog of my early January bout.

We met on Zoom. I was in Massachusetts.

We built websites together. We struggled with floats. We wanted to know how to make things digitally accessible. We wanted to make things look nicer. We didn't want them all to look the same, but we did want a template.

On top of drawing the class, I was drawing all the digital humanities and public events I was attending on the side. Sometimes I brought these topics into class. Sometimes I shared them in Slack. Sometimes they were just percolating in my mind while I was trying to get the HTML to validate.
