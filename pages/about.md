**What is the purpose of classroom notes?**   
When we take notes in class, we are processing what we hear to absorb its lessons. Whether a notetaker transcribes key phrases or synthesize ideas or jot reminders or questions, notes represent an image of fledling ideas. This sketchbook of scraps of a semester's notes.  

**How do we pay attention as we acquire digital skills?**  
Sometimes the possibility of keeping things organized on a computer feels so tantalizingly possible. We sense the structure and hierarchies built into our digital tools, and we sit sometimes unknowingly on the passive training we have from platforms that enforce rules as we submit our data to them. When I stop to think, it boggles my mind the myriad ways we migrate our schedules and records to and from digital spaces.

**But what are these drawings?**  
These drawings are my notes. Records? To absorb information and set myself reminders, I write down salient points. Is the act of writing the part that makes the memory? Or is it in revisiting? How often do I look through the piles of drawings strewn about my apartment?

**Why portraits?**  
I draw what I see and in most cases, my mind is keyed onto the people around me. I see digital tools as places that different people meet and attempt to work out their psychologies. Portraits may be the face of these different psychologies. How people fill a room, I think, relates to how they organize pages on a website. Maybe I draw people's faces to try to understand their sensations. Or to think about how they are gathering information from the world around them. In her essay "On Being Ill," Virginia Woolf talks about the inescapability of the body, its capacity to sharpen or blunt mental perception. Portraits are part of that for me.
