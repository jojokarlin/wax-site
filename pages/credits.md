## The sketches:
The drawings on this site, all drawn by Jojo Karlin, derive from lectures given by Zach Coble and a range of public talks given by other scholars. Special thanks to classmates Rachel Rosado, Wanqi Yue, Victoria Anderson, Camille Baptista, and Bidisha Mahapatra.

## The software:
Wax is a minimal computing ([minicomp](https://github.com/minicomp)) project led by [Marii Nyröp](http://marii.info/). The project is currently maintained by Marii Nyröp at New York University and [Alex Gil](https://github.com/elotroalex) at Columbia University Libraries. It uses open source libraries and frameworks including [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [IIIF](http://iiif.io), [OpenSeaDragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/), [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/), and [ElasticLunr](http://elasticlunr.com/). Wax builds upon work by [Peter Binkley](https://github.com/pbinkley), [David Newbury](https://github.com/workergnome), and others.

Wax welcomes and encourage contributors and maintainers. Please get in touch, or [fork the project on GitHub](https://github.com/minicomp/wax).
